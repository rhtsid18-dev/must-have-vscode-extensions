# Must have VSCode Extensions

A list of vscode extensions that I have found to be essentials in my workflow : -

* [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
  * It's great for avoiding silliy code formatting mistakes in markdown.
  * It's great for keeping a standardized set of linting rules for every contributor in the codebase to follow.
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
  * It's great for code blame where you can view the person who made the last code change on each line of code.
  * It has great command pallet commands which make running git commands a breeze.
* [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)
  * It's great for checking the history of changes made to a single file with graphs and other details.
  * We can compare the file in the current workspace with an older version of the file and see all the changes that are there which is amazing.
* [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)
  * Great tool for looking at a graphical representation of your active branch or all your branchs in one go if that is what you want.
* [gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore)
  * Adds gitignore language support to the file.
  * Provides commands link add .gitignore throught the command pallet using which you can generate a .gitignore file in your repo based on some pre-existing templates.

FYI [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guva-oab1pg) is a great video on youtube from where I referenced most of the git extensions in the list below.
